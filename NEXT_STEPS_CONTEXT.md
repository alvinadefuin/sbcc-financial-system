# SBCC Financial System - Next Steps Context

## ✅ System Status: PRODUCTION READY

### Priority 1: Development Environment ✅
- Local development running on port 3001 with SQLite
- Frontend on port 3000
- Login works (admin seeded from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- Full environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- Environment-specific configuration files created

### Priority 2: Production Database ✅
- Supabase PostgreSQL connected successfully
- Fixed IPv6 connection issue (using Session pooler)
- Production API working at: https://sbcc-financial-system-production.up.railway.app
- Login authentication working
- Database persistence solved

### Priority 3: Google OAuth Setup ✅
- Google Cloud Console configured for dev/prod
- OAuth credentials integrated in both environments
- Google Sign-In working locally and in production
- User linking and authentication fully functional

### Priority 4: Frontend Production Deployment ✅
- Frontend deployed to Vercel
- CORS configured for production
- All endpoints tested and working
- Complete production system operational

### Current System Architecture
```
Development:
- Backend: SQLite (local file) + Google OAuth
- Frontend: localhost:3000 → localhost:3001
- Auth: JWT + Google Sign-In

Production:
- Backend: Supabase PostgreSQL + Google OAuth
- Frontend: Vercel deployment
- Auth: JWT + Google Sign-In (fully operational)
- Status: 🟢 LIVE AND OPERATIONAL
```

- [x] Configure OAuth consent screen with test users ✅

#### 2. Backend Configuration ✅
- [x] Update environment variables with Google Client ID/Secret
- [x] Verify Google OAuth routes are working
- [x] Test callback URL handling

## 💡 Important Context for Next Chat

### Current Issues to Be Aware Of:
1. **Google OAuth is not configured** - Buttons exist but need Google Cloud setup
2. **Frontend is not deployed to production** - Only running locally
3. **No staging environment** - Testing happens in development or production

### Working Endpoints:
- Health: `GET /api/health`
- Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Collections: `GET/POST /api/collections`
- Expenses: `GET/POST /api/expenses`
- Forms: `POST /api/forms/collection`

### Database Status:
- Development: SQLite with test data
- Production: Supabase PostgreSQL (empty except for admin user)

### Authentication:
- JWT-based authentication working
- Admin user: seeded from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (no default password in the repo)
- Google OAuth routes exist but not configured

---

## 📝 For the New Chat, Start With:

"I need to set up Google OAuth for the SBCC Financial System. We've completed:
- Priority 1: Development environment (working)
- Priority 2: Production database (Supabase connected and login working)

Now I need Priority 3: Google OAuth configuration for both development and production environments. The backend routes exist but Google Cloud Console needs to be configured."

---

## 🔗 Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Start development
cd backend && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm start

# Test production login
curl -X POST https://sbcc-financial-system-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"$ADMIN_EMAIL\",\"password\":\"$ADMIN_PASSWORD\"}"

# Test production health
curl https://sbcc-financial-system-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**You're ready for the next phase! Google OAuth will complete the authentication system.** 🚀
