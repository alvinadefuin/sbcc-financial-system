## üí° Important Context for Next Chat

### Current Issues to Be Aware Of:
1. **Google OAuth is not configured** - Buttons exist but need Google Cloud setup
2. **Frontend is not deployed to production** - Only running locally
3. **No staging environment** - Testing happens in development or production

### Working Endpoints:
- Health: `GET /api/health`
- Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Collections: `GET/POST /api/collections`
- Expenses: `GET/POST /api/expenses`
- Forms: `POST /api/forms/collection`

### Database Status:
- Development: SQLite with test data
- Production: Supabase PostgreSQL (empty except for admin user)

### Authentication:
- JWT-based authentication working
- Admin user: admin@sbcc.church / admin123
- Google OAuth routes exist but not configured

---

## üìù For the New Chat, Start With:

"I need to set up Google OAuth for the SBCC Financial System. We've completed:
- Priority 1: Development environment (working)
- Priority 2: Production database (Supabase connected and login working)

Now I need Priority 3: Google OAuth configuration for both development and production environments. The backend routes exist but Google Cloud Console needs to be configured."

---

## üîó Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Start development
cd backend && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm start

# Test production login
curl -X POST https://sbcc-financial-system-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@sbcc.church","password":"admin123"}'

# Test production health
curl https://sbcc-financial-system-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**You're ready for the next phase! Google OAuth will complete the authentication system.** üöÄ
