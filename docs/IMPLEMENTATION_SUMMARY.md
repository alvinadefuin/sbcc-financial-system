# Implementation Summary: Neon DB + n8n Automation

> 📌 **Historical record.** This describes the Neon + n8n rollout as it was built.
> Two things have changed since:
>
> - The **Google Forms → API** workflow is dead. `/api/forms/*` was removed in
>   August 2026 and collections now arrive through the mobile PWA.
> - The API moved from Railway to Vercel serverless functions in `api/`. Any
>   `railway.app` URL below should read `https://sbcc-financial-system.vercel.app`.
> - **All of n8n was removed in August 2026**, along with the `/api/webhooks/*`
>   endpoints described below, the `n8n/` directory, and both runbooks. Nothing
>   had ever called those endpoints — the backup and weekly-report workflows used
>   shell commands and direct PostgreSQL queries, not the API. Everything below
>   about n8n and webhooks is history, not current setup.
>
> The Neon database and the backup / weekly-report workflows are still current.

## 🎯 What Was Built

This branch implements a complete migration from Supabase to Neon DB with n8n automation for robust, always-on financial management.

## 🔄 Modified Files

### Backend Changes

**`backend/server.js`**
- Added webhook routes import
- Registered `/api/webhooks` endpoint

**`backend/config/database-pg.js`**
- Optimized connection pool for Neon DB
- Added keepAlive configuration
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Connection pool monitoring

---

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Always-On Database (Neon DB)
- ✅ No idle pausing (unlike Supabase free tier)
- ✅ Persistent storage (500MB)
- ✅ Better performance with serverless architecture
- ✅ Auto-reconnect on connection loss

### 2. n8n Workflow Automation

#### Workflow #1: Google Forms Processing
**Features:**
- Webhook-based form submission
- User validation before processing
- Automatic retry on API failure (3 attempts)
- Email confirmation to submitter
- Admin alerts on errors
- Duplicate prevention

**Flow:**
```
Google Form Submit
  → n8n Webhook
  → Validate Required Fields
  → Check User Authorization
  → Submit to API (with retry)
  → Send Success Email
  → Respond to Form
```

#### Workflow #2: Daily Database Backup
**Features:**
- Runs daily at 2:00 AM
- Creates PostgreSQL dump
- Uploads to Google Drive
- Keeps last 30 backups
- Email notification on success/failure
- Automatic cleanup of old backups

**Flow:**
```
Cron Trigger (2 AM)
  → pg_dump Database
  → Upload to Google Drive
  → Delete Backups > 30 days
  → Send Email Notification
```

#### Workflow #3: Weekly Financial Report
**Features:**
- Runs every Monday at 8:00 AM
- Queries last week's data
- Calculates summaries and balances
- Generates HTML email report
- Includes expense breakdown by category

**Flow:**
```
Cron Trigger (Monday 8 AM)
  → Query Collections
  → Query Expenses
  → Calculate Summary
  → Generate HTML Report
  → Send Email
```

### 3. Webhook API Endpoints

New endpoints in `/api/webhooks/`:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | n8n health check |
| `/recent-submissions` | GET | Get form submissions (monitoring) |
| `/financial-summary` | GET | Get financial data (for reports) |
| `/budget-alerts` | GET | Check budget thresholds |
| `/form-status` | POST | Receive n8n status updates |
| `/test-connection` | POST | Validate n8n connection |

**Security:** All endpoints require `x-webhook-secret` header

### 4. Database Backup/Restore Scripts

**`scripts/backup-database.sh`**
- Manual backup creation
- Automatic compression (gzip)
- 30-day retention policy
- Error handling

**`scripts/restore-database.sh`**
- Safety backup before restore
- Interactive confirmation
- Error rollback capability

## 📊 Architecture Comparison

### Before (Supabase)
```
Google Forms
    ↓
Apps Script → Direct API Call
    ↓
Railway API
    ↓
Supabase PostgreSQL (pauses when idle ❌)
    ↓
Frontend
```

### After (Neon DB + n8n)
```
Google Forms
    ↓
Apps Script → n8n Webhook (retry + validation ✅)
    ↓
Railway API
    ↓
Neon DB PostgreSQL (always-on ✅)
    ↓
Frontend

Side Benefits:
- Automated backups to Google Drive ✅
- Weekly email reports ✅
- Error monitoring & alerts ✅
- Duplicate prevention ✅
