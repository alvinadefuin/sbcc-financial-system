# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Database Persistence Solution

## The Problem
Your Railway Hobby plan doesn't include persistent volumes, so the SQLite database gets wiped on every deployment. Your Google Forms submissions ARE being saved but are lost when the container restarts.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Railway's PostgreSQL (RECOMMENDED)
Railway offers PostgreSQL databases that persist data properly:

1. **Add PostgreSQL to your Railway project:**
   - Click "+ New" in your Railway project
   - Select "Database" 
   - Choose "PostgreSQL"
   - It will be automatically provisioned

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - Go to your service Variables tab
   - Railway will automatically inject DATABASE_URL
   - Redeploy your service

3. **We'll need to update the backend to support PostgreSQL**
   - Let me know if you want to proceed with this option

### Option 2: Use External Database Service (FREE)
Use a free PostgreSQL service like:

- **Supabase** (https://supabase.com) - 500MB free
- **Neon** (https://neon.tech) - 3GB free  
- **Aiven** (https://aiven.io) - 1 month free trial
- **ElephantSQL** (https://elephantsql.com) - 20MB free

### Option 3: Upgrade Railway Plan
Upgrade to Railway's Pro plan ($20/month) which includes:
- Persistent volumes
- More resources
- Better performance

### Option 4: Deploy Elsewhere
Deploy to a service with persistent storage:
- **Render** (https://render.com) - Includes persistent disk on free tier
- **Fly.io** (https://fly.io) - 3GB persistent volume free
- **Your own VPS** - Full control over storage

## Current Workaround (TEMPORARY)
I've updated the database to use `/app/backend/data` which is more stable than `/tmp`, but it will STILL lose data on redeploys without a volume or external database.

## Why This Happens
- Docker containers are ephemeral by design
- Railway Hobby plan doesn't include persistent volumes  
- SQLite needs persistent file storage
- Every deployment creates a fresh container

## Recommended Action
**Use Railway's PostgreSQL (Option 1)** - It's the easiest solution and integrates seamlessly with your existing Railway setup.
